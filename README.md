# Handwritten-number-recognition
With this program, you can create your own data, train your own model or use existing models. You can save and load data and you can use your model to make predictions

- Create your own dataset
- Train your own model 
- Use existing model
- Use existing dataset

## How to use :

1. After launching the program the home page appears 
![alt text](https://github.com/ChlouisPy/Handwritten-number-recognition/blob/iamges/1.png?raw=true)

  - You can directly start the main script and start drawing a number
  - You can also configure and import certain configurations
    * You can load a dataset with open
    * You can open a pre-trained model

2. After starting, a blank page appears you can draw
  ![alt text](https://github.com/ChlouisPy/Handwritten-number-recognition/blob/iamges/2.png?raw=true)
  - You can press *i* to show your draw
  - You can press *enter* to finish your draw
  - You can press *right click* to reset the draw

3. After pressing *enter* a new window appears

  - The numbers in the center allow you to save your image with what the model should output. This is used to create your own dataset (*-* is if your drawing is bad)
  - In file menu
    * You can see the program and model information
    * You can import a dataset
    * You can export all images and ouput in memory to create a new dataset
    * You can delete the last drawing in memory 
    * You can delete every drawings in memory
  -  In AI menu 
    * You can save or open a new model
    * You can fit your model
    * You can evaluate the model with de last drawing you made 
    * You can evaluate the model with every drawings in memory 
    
## Requirement :
              (*version that i use*)
- Tensorflow  (*2.1.0*)
- Numpy       (*1.18.0*)
